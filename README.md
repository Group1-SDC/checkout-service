# Footwork's Checkout Service
Footwork is a sports goods ecommerce application built with service-oriented architecture, and this is the checkout service of the app. The module allows users to view specific details about a product (name, price, what color(s) it comes in, etc.) and gives users the ability to add the item to a "bag" for later checkout.

For this particular project, I inherited a legacy code base and was tasked with expanding out the back-end infrastructure to store millions of records of data and handle production level traffic. What consitutes "production level," you ask? Think "Best Buy on a Black Friday" levels of web traffic. The process was split into two parts: selecting a database and horizontally scaling. Below, I outline my process.
